# Feature-Based-Image-Classification
Project builds machine learning pipeline for object classification using handcrafted features like HOG and LBP on COIL-20 dataset. It applies PCA and LDA for dimensionality reduction and trains classical ML models, evaluating performance using accuracy and confusion matrix analysis,demonstrating effective object recognition without deep learning.
